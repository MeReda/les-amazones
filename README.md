# Les Amazones

Welcome to the Les Amazones website, a platform designed to support individuals who have been affected by breast cancer. This project was developed as a final study project for a `nurse student` as a `Final Study Project` and aims to provide relevant information, support, and resources to those in need. 

The platform features the following sections:
- Espace Soutien :
  A support area for breast cancer patients and survivors.

- Esthétique :
  A section dedicated to cosmetic treatments for breast cancer patients.

- Espace Bien-Être :
  A wellness area to help patients manage the physical and emotional side effects of breast cancer treatment.

- ASBL :
  A non-profit organization dedicated to supporting breast cancer patients and their families.

- Citations :
  Inspiring quotes and messages to help breast cancer patients stay motivated and optimistic.


Our goal is to create a comprehensive and accessible resource for those who are looking for information and support. We hope that this platform will help bring comfort and ease to those who are going through a difficult time.
